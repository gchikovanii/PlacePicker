# Place Picker

# Overview
Place Picker is a web application that allows users to select and mark places they have visited. The application is built using Angular, leveraging HTTP requests for CRUD operations, real-time updates using signals, custom error handling, observable operators, manual rollback, and optimistic updates to improve the user experience.

# Features
CRUD Operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete places they have visited.

Real-Time Updates: The application uses signals to provide real-time updates, ensuring that all users see the latest information.

Custom Error Handling: Custom error messages are displayed to the users, improving the overall usability of the application.

Observable Operators: Angular's observable operators are used to manage asynchronous data streams effectively.

Manual Rollback: The application includes a manual rollback mechanism to revert changes if an operation fails.

Optimistic Updates: The application performs optimistic updates to provide a smoother and faster user experience by updating the UI before the server response.

Error Handling: Custom error handling is implemented to provide users with meaningful feedback in case of any issues during CRUD operations. Manual rollback mechanisms ensure that data consistency is maintained even in case of failures.
